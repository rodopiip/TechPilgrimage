# TechPilgrimage

## Introduction

Hello! I am an architectural graduate with a master's degree in architecture, and I have recently completed a 6-month course in Java focusing on backend development. The aim of this repository is to document my journey as I expand my skill set in the tech industry.

## Update
As of 23.06.23 I have automatically started pushing my Leetcode coding solutions to GitHub via the [LeetHUb v2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub-v2/mhanfgfagplhgemhjfeolkkdidbakocm) Chrome extention.

## Interests and Objectives

After gaining significant experience in architecture, I'm interested in merging my design skills with my newfound passion for programming. I believe my architectural background gives me a unique perspective on programming and problem solving. Currently, I'm more inclined towards programming but am actively exploring hybrid roles that can synergize both fields.

## Content

This repository documents my daily practice and learning progress in the following areas:

- LeetCode solutions
- SQL queries
- Programming tests from IndiaBIX
- Learning Docker (yet to start)
- Exploring Jira (yet to start)
- Handling Geospatial data (yet to start)
- IntelliJ Projects

Each of these topics has a dedicated directory in this repository.

## Repository Structure

Each directory will have its README that gives a brief overview of the content and progress made in each area.
