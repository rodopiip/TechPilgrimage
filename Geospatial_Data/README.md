# Geospatial Data

## Update - Initial Learning Phase

I have begun my theoretical preparation for a small-scale project using Python and GeoPandas. The aim of this project is to leverage the capabilities of GeoPandas for spatial data analysis.

Here's a brief overview of what I've studied:

- **GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame**: These are the primary data structures in GeoPandas, which function similarly to Series and DataFrame in pandas.
- **Reading and writing data**: I've looked into how GeoPandas can read and write data from multiple file formats.
- **Geometric operations**: GeoPandas allows for operations such as intersections, unions, and differences between shapes.
- **Spatial joins**: I've explored how GeoDataFrames can be joined based on their spatial relationships, much like a SQL JOIN operation but with a spatial twist.

This is just the beginning. I am excited to dive deeper into GeoPandas and start implementing my learning into practical projects.
